# Album Tags Data Migration

This script is intended to be run against a local staging version of the Album Tags codebase. It uses two versions of the `request` module to gather all necessary data from the production version of Album Tags *(which connects to the MongoDB Album Tags database).* It then processes this data and attempts to enter it into whatever SQL database is currently connected to the local staging version of Album Tags. This allows me to easily assure that the SQL version of the Album Tags database up to date with the live MongoDB version. In the event that it becomes possible to cut over to the SQL database-layer version of the app in production, this script will help prevent data loss for users who added data while the new database-layer was being written.
