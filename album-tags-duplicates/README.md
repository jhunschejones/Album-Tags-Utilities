# Duplicate Albums Utility

This script uses the HTTParty request gem to pull all the albums from whichever version of Album Tags is running locally. It then parses the data and pulls out duplicate albums based on a method that simplifies artist and album names down to all-caps, keyword phrases. I have had success with a similar approach in the past with the MongoDB version of the Album Tags database. Usually a duplicate album results from a band changing something small about their name or album title, like capitalization. This often results in a new Apple Music Album ID, so it is often possible to catch duplicates with the [Album Tags Expired Data Utility](~https://github.com/jhunschejones/Album-Tags-Utilities/tree/master/album-tags-expired~). There are some exceptions where Apple leaves both versions of the album available, and this script will help uncover those edge cases.
