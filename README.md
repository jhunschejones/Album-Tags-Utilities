# Album-Tags-Utilities


## Overview:
Album Tags is a data app that allows users to share music with friends and categorize their own music libraries for easy reference. It combines the resources of the Apple Music API with the power of custom tags, user favorites, album connections, and custom user lists in an easy-to-use platform accessible on desktop and mobile browsers.

This repo holds utility scripts that are used to maintain the Album Tags application. These scripts range in purpose from insuring data integrity to migration assistance. If you have any improvements to suggest, please feel free to reach out. I am always happy to collaborate to make this project better!
